    \begin{frame}{Maximum Leaf Spanning Tree}
        \begin{block}<1->{Spanning Tree}
            A spanning tree T, of a graph G, is a subgraph that includes all the vertices of the original graph and is a tree (i.e., a connected, acyclic graph). 
        \end{block}
        \vspace{0.75cm}
        \begin{block}<2->{Maximum Leaf Spanning Tree}
            A maximum leaf spanning tree is a spanning tree that maximizes the number of leaf nodes (vertices with degree 1) in the spanning tree. 
        \end{block}

    \begin{frame}{Problem Definition}
        The Maximum Leaf Spanning Tree (MaxLST) problem comes in two primary versions.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item<2-> \textbf{Optimization Version:} \\In this version, the goal is to maximize the number of leaf nodes in the spanning tree of a given graph.
            \item<3-> \textbf{Decision Version:}\\The decision version of the MLST problem asks whether it is possible to find a spanning tree with at least a given number of leaf nodes.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}{Optimization Version of MaxLST}
        \textbf{Problem Statement:}
        \begin{itemize}[<+->]
            \item \textbf{Input:} \par A connected, undirected graph $ G=(V,E) $, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges.
            \item \textbf{Objective:} \par Find a spanning tree of $G$ that maximizes the number of leaf nodes 
        \end{itemize}
    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}{Decision Version of MaxLST}
        \textbf{Problem Statement:}
        \begin{itemize}[<+->]
            \item \textbf{Input:} \par A connected, undirected graph $ G=(V,E) $, and an integer $k$.
            \item \textbf{Question:} \par Does there exist a spanning tree of $G$ with at least $k$ leaf nodes? 
        \end{itemize}

\begin{section}{Complexity Analysis of MaxLST}
    \begin{frame}{Complexity of MaxLST}
        \begin{description}[<+->]
            \item[The MaxLST problem], particularly the decision version of the problem is an NP-Complete problem. Which means that the problem is both in the NP and NP-Hard class of problems.
            \item[NP problems] or Nondeterministic Polynomial time problem is the set of all decision problems solvable in polynomial time by a non-deterministic algorithm. A problem is in NP if it's solution can be verified in polynomial time.
            \item[NP-Hard Problems] are the set of all those problems that are as hard as the hardest problem in NP. We prove a problem is NP-Hard by reducing an instance of a well known NP problem such as 3-SAT, Vertex Cover, Independent Set to an instance of the relevant problem
        \end{description}
    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}{Proof: MaxLST is in NP}
        \begin{itemize}
            \setlength{\itemsep}{15pt}
            \item Given a solution $T$, for a Graph $G=(V,E)$ and a integer $k$ is given, we can just check if the tree has k leaves or more.
            \item By applying a simple BFS or DFS we can both check
            \begin{itemize}
                \setlength{\itemsep}{3pt}  
                \item[] -- if the solution is indeed a spanning tree.
                \item[] -- if it has k leaves.
            \end{itemize}
            \item So, the MaxLST problem is in NP
        \end{itemize}
    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}{Proof: MaxLST is in NP-Hard}
        We prove the NP-hardness of Max-Leaf Spanning Tree in two steps -\\
        \begin{enumerate} [<+->]
            \setlength{\itemsep}{5pt}
            \item Reduce the Minimum Vertex Cover problem to Minimum Connected Dominating Set (MinCDS) problem.
            \item Show that Minimum Connected Dominating Set is equivalent to Max-Leaf Spanning Tree problem.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{frame}
    \begin{frame}{Minimum Vertex Cover Problem}
        \begin{description}[<+->]
            \item[Vertex Cover:]Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges, a vertex cover is a subset of vertices $C \subseteq V$ such that every edge in the graph has at least one of its endpoints in $C$. 
            \item[Objective:] We want a subset $C \subseteq V$ such that for every edge $(u,v) \in E$, at least one of the vertices $u$ or $v$ is in $C$, and the number of vertices in $C$ is minimized. 
            \item[Question:]Given a connected graph $G = (V, E)$ and an integer $k$, does $G$ have a vertex cover of size at most $k$?

        Given a vertex cover instance $G = (V, E)$, we reduce it to a minimum connected dominating set instance $G' = (V', E')$ as follows -
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $G'$ has the complete graph induced by V.
            \item for each edge $(u,v) \in E$ we add a node $x_{uv}$ in $V'$ and add two edges $(u,x_{uv})$ and $(v,x_{uv})$
        \end{itemize}
        Formally-
        \begin{exampleblock}{}
            \centering
            \[
                V' = V \cup \{ x_{uv} : (u,v) \in E\} \\

                \item $v \in V $: By the definition of vertex cover we know that $v$ is dominated by $S$
                \item $v=v_{xy}$ is an edge vertex: Because $(x,y)$ is covered by $S$, then $x \in S$ or $y \in S$, $v_{xy}$ is dominated by $S$

                \item We first observe that for any edge vertex $v_{xy}$ in, it can only be dominated by $x$ or $y$
                \item For any edge vertex $v_{xy} \in S$. The replacement does not increase the cardinality of $S$ and mantains $S$'s property of being a dominating set.
                \item Now $S$ contains no edge vertex, so every edge vertex is dominated by $S$, that is to say, every edge in $G$ has at least one endpoint in $S$
.

             Let $T$ be a spanning tree of the sub-graph induced by $S$. For each vertex $v \in V \backslash S$, there exists a vertex $u \in S$ where $(u,v) \in E$. We add these vertices $u$ and the edges $(u, v)$ to $T$. All newly added nodes are new in $T$, has a degree of 1 and doesn't add a cycle. That is, $T$ is still a spanning tree. Therefore, $|Leaves(T)| \geq n - k$

                \item Improves upon the previous approach where leaves of a subtree of the graph were repeatedly branched in order to decide whether it can remain a leaf or must become an internal node of the spanning tree. (Kneis et.al and Dalgaut et. al)
                \item In that approach branching on nodes of small degree (with two possible successors) becomes the worst case resulting in a bad running time.
                \item Fernau et. al improved upon the technique by marking nodes as leaves as early as possible even when they are not yet attached to an internal node.

                \item Solis-soba et. al introduced prioritized expansion rules to improve the approximation ratio to 2 for graphs with maximum degree of at least 3. 
                \item The priority of a rule reflects the number of leaves that the rule adds to the forest. Hence it is desirable to use only ‘high’ priority rules to build the forest.
                \item The ‘low’ priority rules are needed though to ensure that the number of components of the forest can be kept small enough.

                Let $F$ be a a (possibly empty) subgraph of a graph $G$. The operation of expanding a vertex $v \in V(G)$ consists of -
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item[] -- Adding $v$ to $F$, in case $v \notin V(F)$
                    \item[] -- For every $w \in N_G(v) \backslash V(F)$: adding vertex $w$ and edge $(v,w)$ to $F$
                \end{itemize}
                This operation yields a new subgraph $F'$ of $G$ which is a forest if F was a forest and if $v \notin V(F)$ it increases the number of components of F by 1

        \end{frame}
        \begin{frame}{Expansion Rules}
            We use the following four expansion rules, where the given order defines the priorities. That is, if for any node Rule 2 can be applied, then Rule 3 or 4 can't be applied.
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item If $F$ contains a vertex $v$ with at least two neighbors in $\overline{V(F)}$, then expand $v$.
                \item  If $F$ contains a vertex $v$ with only one neighbor $w$ in $\overline{V(F)}$, which in turn has at least three neighbors in $\overline{V(F)}$, then first expand $v$, and next expand $w$.
                \item If $F$ contains a vertex $v$ with only one neighbor $w$ in $\overline{V(F)}$, which in turn has two neighbors in $\overline{V(F)}$, then first expand $v$, and next expand $w$.
                \item If$\overline{V(F)}$ contains a vertex $v$ with at least three neighbors in $\overline{V(F)}$, then expand $v$.

            As we can see that, only rule 4 can increase the number of components. As this rule has the least priority, we limit the number of components. Also, once a new component has been introduced no other rule can change this as they don't operate on nodes already in the forest.\\
            Since G has a maximum degree of at least 3, Rule 4 also ensures that the resulting forest is never empty.

    Phylogenetic trees are designed to increase species representation while minimizing internal nodes. MLST contributes to this by identifying spanning trees with the greatest number of leaves, reflecting genuine species, and minimizing inferred shared ancestors. \newline \newline
    This is important for taxonomy and evolutionary studies because it allows researchers to focus on actual species rather than hypothetical ancestors.

            \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Clustering:}\newline  MLST can be used as a clustering algorithm, where each cluster is represented by a node in the spanning tree. The minimum latency ensures that clusters are closely related.\cite{gupta2003simpler}
          \newline
          \item \textbf{QoS Provisioning: }\newline
          Ensuring that quality of service (QoS) requirements are met for different applications.\cite{swamy2004primal}

                By maximizing leaves, internal nodes are minimized. This is crucial in distributed systems where internal nodes represent servers or resources responsible for routing or control. Minimizing such nodes reduces complexity and resource consumption.\newline \newline
                This leads to more efficient communication and control protocols.\cite{PAYAN1984267}
